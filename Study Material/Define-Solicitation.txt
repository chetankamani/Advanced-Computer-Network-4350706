Solicitation is the act of asking for something, especially in a persuasive or urgent way. It can be used to ask for money, donations, information, help, or even to commit a crime.

Here are some examples of solicitation:

A charity asking for donations to help victims of a natural disaster
A salesperson calling or knocking on doors to sell a product or service
A politician asking for votes or campaign donations
A job recruiter contacting potential candidates about open positions
A person asking for money on the street


Solicitation can be legal or illegal, depending on the context. For example, it is legal for a charity to solicit donations, but it is illegal to solicit bribes.

Solicitation can also be done in a variety of ways, including:

Face-to-face
Over the phone
By mail
Through email
Online


Here are some examples of solicitation that are illegal:

Solicitation of drugs

If you are unsure whether a particular type of solicitation is legal, it is always best to consult with an attorney.
