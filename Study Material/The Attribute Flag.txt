The Attribute Flag:

The first high order bit (from the left) is the optional bit, setting this bit to 1 means the attribute is optional and to 0 defines a well-known attribute. Origin is a well-known mandatory attribute so this bit is set to zero as you can see.

The second high order bit is the transitive bit. It defines whether the attribute is transitive (value=1) or non-transitive (value=0). Well-known attributes are always transitive and therefore their transitive bit is always set to one.

The third bit is the partial bit, it defines whether the information in the optional transitive attribute is partial (value= 1) or complete (value = 0). Well-known and optional non-transitive are always set to complete. The partial bit is set to 1 in the following cases:


Ezoic
Unrecognized optional transitive attribute that is passed to peers, the sender sets the partial bit.
Optional transitive attribute attached by some router other than the originator or the route.
The fourth bit is the extended length bit and it defines whether the attribute length is one octet or more. The last four bits are not currently used.

The sender orders path attributes in an ascending order (according to attribute type code) within the update message as shown in the packet capture above.
